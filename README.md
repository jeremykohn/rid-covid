# Radiological Image Data for Clinical Open-source Viral Infection Diagnosis (RID-COVID)

A list of software projects, datasets, and other publicly available resources for diagnosing COVID-19 based on clinical images such as X-rays and CT scans.

For now, the goal is to help people find what already exists. Eventually this effort may develop into a project to produce new diagnostic tools suitable for clinical use.

- [BrixIA: COVID19 severity score assessment project and database](https://brixia.github.io/)
  - Dataset description: We designed an end-to-end deep learning architecture for predicting, on Chest X-rays images (CRX), a multi-regional score conveying the degree of lung compromise in COVID-19 patients. Such scoring system, namely Brixia score, was applied in serial monitoring of such patients, showing significant prognostic value, in one of the hospitals that experienced one of the highest pandemic peaks in Italy. Moreover, we provide the full dataset with the related metadata and Brixia score annotations, and the code to reproduce our results.

This list focuses on a specific topic: image-based diagnosis of COVID-19.
