# Radiological Image Data for Clinical Open-source Viral Infection Diagnosis (RID-COVID)

A list of software projects, datasets, and other publicly available resources for diagnosing COVID-19 based on clinical images such as X-rays and CT scans.

For now, the goal is to help people find what already exists. Eventually this effort may develop into a project to produce new diagnostic tools suitable for clinical use.
